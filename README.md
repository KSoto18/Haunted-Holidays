## APIs

We used the [Haunted Places API](https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places) by [Timothy Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner).

We also used [Google Maps API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/) to include the haunted places locations on a map with their name, city, state, and description.
